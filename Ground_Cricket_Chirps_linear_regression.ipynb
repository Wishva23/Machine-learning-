        "#Ground Cricket Chirps\n",
        "In The Song of Insects (1948) by George W. Pierce, Pierce mechanically measured the frequency (the number of wing vibrations per second) of chirps (or pulses of sound) made by a striped ground cricket, at various ground temperatures. Since crickets are ectotherms (cold-blooded), the rate of their physiological processes and their overall metabolism are influenced by temperature. Consequently, there is reason to believe that temperature would have a profound effect on aspects of their behavior, such as chirp frequency.\n",

        "In general, it was found that crickets did not sing at temperatures colder than 60° F or warmer than 100° F.\n",

        "Find the equation's  score (use the .score method) to determine whether the equation is a good fit for this data. (0.8 and greater is considered a strong correlation.)\n",

        "Extrapolate data: If the ground temperature reached 95° F, then at what approximate rate would you expect the crickets to be chirping?\n",
